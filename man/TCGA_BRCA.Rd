\title{Selected Variables from BReast CAncer Patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project}
\description{
A subset of clinical and genetic data concerning breast cancer patients (mainly female patients) from the database The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) http://cancergenome.nih.gov/.

The Cancer Genome Atlas study collects clinical and genomic data from different tumors. 
This dataset incorporates selected variables from patients with BReast CAncer.

The data set TCGA_BRCA contains data about 999 patients. Each row corresponds to one patient and gives five basic pieces of information:

- information on TP53 gene mutation,
-	patientâ€™s gender,
-	information whether the patient lived for five years after the surgery,
-	number of days between the surgery and death (if it occurred),
-	information whether there was a relapse and a new tumor.
